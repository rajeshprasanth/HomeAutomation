# Home Automation

Welcome to the **HomeAutomation** repository! This repository contains various sub-projects designed to automate tasks in your home using Arduino, sensors, and other components.

## Projects

### 1. [Arduino Relay Timer](./ArduinoRelayTimer)
This project demonstrates how to control a relay at a specific time every day using an Arduino Nano and a DS1307 RTC module. The relay remains active for a predefined duration before turning off.

#### Features
- Trigger a relay at a specified time daily.
- Keep the relay active for a configurable duration.
- Display the current time, target time, and relay status on the Serial Monitor.

#### Highlights
- Components: Arduino Nano, DS1307 RTC, Relay Module
- Dependencies: RTClib library
- Status: Completed âœ…

### 2. [Future Project Placeholder](./Future_Project)
(Example sub-project description goes here. You can remove or update this section as needed.)

#### Features
- Description of the features for the placeholder project.

#### Highlights
- Components: Placeholder
- Status: In Progress ðŸŸ¡
